1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
in the 2010 Ford SVT Raptor.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,200
I liked it so much, I bought one.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,160
Here it is.

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,160
We're going back to Bull Run this year, of course, with

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,920
help from our friends at Black Magic.

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,120
And we're so serious about it, we got two Valentine I radar

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,200
detectors.

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,440
Oh, yeah.

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,600
So we're all set up.

10
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,560
And the reason we got two is because we're going to be

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,240
going a little bit faster.

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,080
We got a 2011 Shelby GT500 with a 550 horsepower engine.

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,040
All aluminum V8.

14
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,320
We are going to be right in the action, bringing you guys a

15
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,440
video every single day, live from the Bull Run rally, July

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,680
9 to 16.

17
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,920
And the only place to watch it is on blackmagicshine.com, or

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:57,960
right here on the Smoking Tire.
